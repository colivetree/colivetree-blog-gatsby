How this happened:

I was writing a blog post on proprietary distribution channels and it just felt off to plan on publishing it on substack or medium only.

I also saw a [tweet](https://twitter.com/celso/status/1300144121932320769) by Celso Martinho recently, describing how he'd migrated his blog to Cloudflare Workers. 

I had also been playing around with Gatsby and wanted to use one of their [starter templates](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) to build my own site, which had been pretty neglected recently. 

The layout will change significantly over the next few weeks, but this is as good a place to start as any other.

All of these bring us to this moment in time. 

I'll be publishing my thoughts on product, the internet and whatever else comes to mind on here. As is also true in surfing, the best surfer out there is the one having the most fun. 

So let's get out there and catch some waves. Hope you'll have just as much fun alongside me.
